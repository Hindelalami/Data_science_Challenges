<h4>Classification of fetal ultrasound</h4>
 <div> in this project , we have some medical images of fetal , we need to preprocess those images before apply any model to classify those images into some categories 
 The goal of this challenge is to evaluate the maturity of current Deep Learning classification techniques for their application in a real maternal-fetal clinical environment.
It is based on this (paper) published in Nature where a dataset of routinely acquired maternal-fetal screening ultrasound images was collected from two different hospitals by several operators and ultrasound machines. All images were manually labeled by an expert maternal fetal clinician. Images can be classified as fetal anatomical planes of Brain (Trans-thalamic, Trans-cerebellum, Trans-ventricular) or other plane (Other).

  <h4>Hand gesture recognition</h4>
 <div> In this challenge, we have to build a model to classify 16 hand gestures of the Moroccan sign language alphabet. The data was collected using a 3D Kinect sensor in 2018 at the LIMIARF Laboratory of Mohammed V University of Rabat in Morocco. The project attempted to recognize in real time the Moroccan sign language

  <h4>Cardiovascular disease identification</h4>
 <div> The Ohsumed dataset is a subset of the MEDLINE database, which is a bibliographic database of important, peer-reviewed medical literature maintained by the National Library of Medicine. The subset we consider is the collection consisting of the first 13,929 documents from the 50,216 medical abstracts of the year 1991. The dataset is divided into 6,286 for training and 7,643 for testing.

The specific task aims to categorize the 23 cardiovascular diseases categories from 0 to 22. This is a multi-label classification task which means that each document can be attributed to more than one category.

   <h4>Morrocan darija word classification</h4>
 <div>  In this challenge, we have to build a model to recognize two spoken words of Moroccan Darija: "yallahbda" and "safi7bess". The data was collected in 2018 at the LIMIARF Laboratory of Mohammed V University of Rabat during a project within the IOSM Master at ENSIAS.
