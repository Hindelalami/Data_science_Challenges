these repository contain multiple kaggle machine learning projects about multiple topics. 



<ul>
  <li>Classification of fetal ultrasound brain  </li>
  <li>Hand gesture recognition  </li>
  <li>Cardiovascular disease identification </li>
  <li>Morrocan darija word classification </li>

  
  
<h4>Classification of fetal ultrasound</h4>
 <div> in this project , we have some medical images of fetal , we need to preprocess those images before apply any model to classify those images into some categories
  </div>
  
  <h4>Hand gesture recognition</h4>
 <div> The aim of this project is to build a machine learning model able to recognize some hand gesture.
  </div>
  
  <h4>Cardiovascular disease identification</h4>
 <div> While this project aims to build a machine learning model capable of identifying cardiovascular disease based on some criterias .
   
  </div>
  
   <h4>Morrocan darija word classification</h4>
 <div>  Giving some audios of morrocan darija word , we build a machine learning model that can recognize morrocan dialect it classifies two morroca words: 'hbess' wich mean and ''
   
  </div>
